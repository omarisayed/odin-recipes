    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Kunefe also known as kunafa or knafeh is one of the heavenly Turkish desserts made with syrup. It is mostly served at kebab restaurants after the main course like doner kebab. It is made with cheese and shredded Kadayif noodles soaked in sweet syrup.

    <p>
        What makes this dessert different from other syrupy desserts is that it must be eaten hot, right after it is cooked. Also, The quality of cheese inside is pretty significant to reach this perfection. It must be an unsalted melting cheese so that it complements sweetness of the dessert.

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tantuni is a type of kebab. It consists of cooking small pieces of meat, either beef or chicken. Generally prepared with chopped tomatoes, and an onion mix and spices. Served in thin wraps and lavash. Tantuni originated from the Turkish city of Mersin, then spread all around. Now it is famous all around Turkey and most of Europe.

        <p>
            Starting from the end of the XVth century, a Mongolian community lived around Mersin. Even today, there is a neighborhood named after them. The word Tantuni might have been derived from the Mongolian word tamturi, which meant to have a snack, to eat in small bites.
